While he was walking between the shelves, he saw something strange. There was a blue book that looked different from the others. It was dusty and looked ancient. Max reached out his hand.

They walked past the art room and the gym. Suddenly, there was a loud crash of thunder. BOOM! The lights in the hallway flickered and went out. Now, it was quite dark.\n
\"I am scared,\" Lily said softly. She held Max's arm.\n
\"Do not worry,\" Max said, trying to be brave. \"I have a flashlight.\" He pulled a small yellow torch from his bag and turned it on. The beam of light cut through the darkness.\n
They reached the back door, but there was a problem. A metal gate blocked the way. It was usually open, but today it was closed.\n
