They were very beautiful.\n\nLeo had no brothers or sisters on the station. Sometimes he was lonely. He wanted a friend to play with. He played with his toy cars, but it was not the same. He read books about planets. He ate his space food. But he always went back to the window.\n\nOne night, Leo looked at the dark sky. The stars shined like small lights. He counted them. 'One, two, three,' he said. Everything was the same as always. The moon was quiet. The Earth was blue. But then, Leo saw something strange. He looked harder. It was not a star. It was not a planet. It was something different on the moon.",
